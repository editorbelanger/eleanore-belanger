    <h2>Let me tell you a story.</h2>
    <p>When I was a kid, my mom gave me a book that she knew I would love. It was about pirates! But every time I picked it up, something held me back. I couldn’t get into it. Not because the story didn’t have potential, but because the errors jumped off the page at me.</p>
    <p>But instead of putting it down, I fixed it. I grabbed a pencil and marked up the margins. I corrected the typos, reworded awkward phrases, and made sure the punctuation was right. I revised the text so I could focus on the fun pirate story.</p>
    <p>This wasn’t the only time I marked up a book’s margins to make sure the story was as strong as it could be, and that childhood habit grew into a career. Now I'm an editor who specializes in making complex information clear, engaging, and accurate. I have a degree in technical communication, and I've worked in government, EdTech, and publishing. I’ve edited research reports, learning curriculum, and lifestyle content. Along the way, I’ve helped a nonprofit build editorial standards from the ground up, and I’ve refined novels that transport readers to new worlds.</p>
    <p>No matter the project, my goal is always to make sure the writing is grammatically correct, factually accurate, and stylistically consistent.</p>
    <p>When I’m not buried in style guides, you’ll find me exploring the South Carolina coast with my family and my standard poodle, Jinkx (who’s sure she’s the one in charge).</p>
